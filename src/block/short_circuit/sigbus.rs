//! Process-global SIGBUS diagnostic handler for the short-circuit mmap path.
//!
//! A SIGBUS while touching a block mapping means the underlying file was
//! truncated / replaced **while the Worker was supposed to be holding the block
//! lock** — i.e. INV-D1 (the immutability protocol, design  / ) was
//! violated. There is no safe way to *recover* inside a signal handler: SIGBUS
//! fires at an arbitrary faulting instruction (e.g. deep in `memcpy`), and
//! unwinding from a signal handler through libc frames is UB. `catch_unwind`
//! cannot catch a signal either.
//!
//! Therefore the only correct response is to **fail loudly**: emit an
//! async-signal-safe diagnostic line to stderr and `abort()`. This turns a
//! protocol violation into an immediate, observable crash rather than silently
//! returning torn / stale bytes (which would break data consistency, a).
//!
//! Deployments that need to tolerate untrusted/mutable backing files should use
//! the `pread` data plane instead of mmap (design ) rather than relying on
//! signal recovery.
//!
//! The handler is installed once per process (idempotent) and only on unix.
